            <br>
            <p>
            50% of adults have ill mental-health linked to the stresses of debt (Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2010).
            <br>
            Debt has been shown to have an impact on:
            <ul>
            <li> Emotional regulation</li>
            <li> Personal relationships</li>
            <li> Self-esteem</li>
            <li> Social inclusion</li>
            <br>
            (Mind, 2023)
        </ul>

            <br>
            So what is being done to help people going through ill mental health due to debt? (Mind, 2023)
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Money Advice Liaison Groups: These are forums created to provide an empathetic service with information
                    and advice. These groups also provide guidance to financial organisations on how to communicate clearly and with more
                    understanding to customers via 'Good practice mental health guidelines' (2009).
                </li>
                <li>Credit Crunch Stressline: This is an NHS helpline for people experiencing emotional distress due to
                issues with debt and wider financial difficulties. This helpline provides support and advice.</li>
                <li>The Lending Code: This is a protocol created by The British Banking Association (2005) on how creditors
                should treat customers experiencing financial problems alongside associated mental health conditions.</li>
                <li>Government Policy: New Horizons is a partnership organisation with the government to support
                public health research and information for organisations on how to best tackle debt and mental health
                in daily practice (Department of Health, 2011). </li>
            </ul>
                <br>
            We would recommend that you please seek professional support if you are experiencing financial difficulty and  that is
            affecting your wellbeing.
            <br>
            If you or anyone you know is in a mental health crisis, please call one of the following:
