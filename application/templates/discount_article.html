    <p>
        When purchasing items online such as food, clothes or event tickets, rather than going to retailers directly, you could visit those same companies via a cashback site and get paid for your custom! You can sign up for these sites (which are usually free or very low cost, via an annual subscription. Once logged in, access the companies you wish to purchase from and get ordering! After your purchases, an amount of saved cashback earnings will accumulate in your account.
