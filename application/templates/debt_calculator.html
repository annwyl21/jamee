A rough plan for the debt feedback page

<p>You have 4 debts.</p>
<ul>
    loan type, loan size, interest rate - total that you will pay back to the lender

<p>If you chose to pay them using a snowball approach, they would be paid off in order of debt size:
    <ul>
        loan type, loan size, - paid after x months
        loan type, loan size, - paid after x months
        loan type, loan size, - paid after x months
    </ul>

    If you chose a stack approach, they would be paid off in order of interest rate:
    <ul>
        loan type, highest interest rate - paid after x months
        loan type lowest interest rate - paid after x months
    </ul>
</p>
